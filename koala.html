                            <h3>KOALA</h3>
                            <p> The koala or, inaccurately, koala bear[a] (Phascolarctos cinereus), is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native
                                to Australia. It is the only extant representative of the family Vombatidae. It is found in coastal areas of the 
                                mainland's eastern and southern regions, inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia and 
                                is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and a large, large, spoon-shaped 
                                nose. The koala has a body length of 68-85 cm (24-33 in) and weighs 4-15 kg (9-33 lb) and their fur colour ranges from 
                                silver grey to chocolate brown.</p>
                          <p>Koalas typically inhabit open eucalypt woodlands, and the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet. Because 
                             this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and caloric content,koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to 20 hours 
                             a day. They are asocial animals, and bonding exists only between mothers and dependant offspring. Adult males 
                             communicate with loud bellows that intimidate rivals and attract males. Males mark their with secretions from scent 
                             glands located on their chests.</p> 
      
                          <p>Koalas are herbivorous creatures that are found in open forests and woodlands as 
                             well as areas with tropical and cool temperature climates.</p>
                          <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p> 
      
                          <p>You will find the koalas at pen K91, in the lost forest.</p>
